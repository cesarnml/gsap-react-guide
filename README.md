# GSAP & React Samples
[![Dependency Status](https://img.shields.io/david/rhernandog/gsap-forums-react.svg)](https://david-dm.org/rhernandog/gsap-forums-react)
## Description
This is a collection of samples used in the GreenSock forums for React related threads.

The main focus is to group all the samples and the reference to the threads they were created for, as a guide of the different ways of using GSAP to animate DOM elements in a React app.

#### Important Note
The code and bundling on this repository is not meant for production code, just development and learning purposes. If you want to deploy some part of this code into a production app, use a startup of your like, such as Create React App or other, and then include the code in that bundling environment.

## Installing
Just clone the repo:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/rhernandog/gsap-forums-react.git
```
Or just download the ZIP file and extract it in your local machine.

Then install the dependencies:
```
$ npm install
```

## Live Samples and Edit
In order to view the live samples you need to open the `index.js` file in the `src/` folder. In it import the sample you want from the `src/components/` folder and run:
```
$ npm start
```
To update the styles change the files in the `src/styles/` folder. The `base.css` file is the one used as well... base for all the samples. Then each sample might have a specific stylesheet that's imported in the specific `js` file in the `src/components/` folder.
